    <string name="why">Why Use The Values Visualizer?</string>
    <string name="why_text">Values can explain our behavior and attitudes. One of the reasons why we may be satisfied with one employer but feel uncomfortable with another employer could be hidden within our values. Understanding our own values and reflecting on employer’s values may help navigate career development. We built Values Visualizer to help you comprehend your personal values, discover your [current or prospective] employer’s values, and compare both results on a chart.</string>
    <string name="what">What Is The Values Visualizer?</string>
    <string name="what_text">We are using the Schwartz Theory of Basic Human Values. It outlines values which are believed to be universal across cultures. The provided survey is an adapted version of the Schwartz Value Survey.</string>
